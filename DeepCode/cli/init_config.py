"""``deepcode init`` — one-time setup so ``deepcode`` runs in any directory.

DeepCode resolves its config like Codex / Claude Code: a user-level base at
``deepcode_home()`` (``$DEEPCODE_HOME`` or ``~/.deepcode``) that is independent
of the current directory, deep-merged with an optional project-level file. The
base is where a provider key lives, so once it exists the ``deepcode`` command
works from anywhere.

This command creates that base for the user instead of asking them to copy
files by hand. It is a single Python implementation that adapts to Windows,
macOS and Linux (``pathlib.Path.home()`` resolves ``%USERPROFILE%`` / ``$HOME``
uniformly; the printed shell hints are tailored per OS). It never overwrites an
existing config unless ``--force`` is given, so re-running it is safe.
